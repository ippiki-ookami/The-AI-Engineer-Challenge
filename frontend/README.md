## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **OpenAI API Key**: Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. **Backend Server**: Make sure the FastAPI backend is running (see `/api/README.md`)

### Running the Frontend

1. **Start the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd api
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

2. **Open the Frontend**:
   - Simply open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser
   - Or serve it using a local server:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     python -m http.server 8080
     ```
     Then visit `http://localhost:8080`

3. **Configure Your API Key**:
   - Enter your OpenAI API key in the input field
   - Click "Save" to store it securely in your browser

4. **Start Chatting**:
   - Choose your preferred model from the dropdown
   - Type your message and press Enter to send
   - Use Shift+Enter for new lines

## Usage Guide

### Basic Chatting
- Type your message in the input field at the bottom
- Press Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new lines
- The AI will respond with streaming text

### Model Selection
- Use the dropdown in the header to switch between models
- Different models have different capabilities and costs
- Settings are saved automatically

### Settings
- Click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) to open settings
- Customize your system prompt for different learning scenarios
- Change themes between dark and light
- Set your default model

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl/Cmd + K`: Focus on message input
- `Ctrl/Cmd + L`: Clear chat history
- `Escape`: Close modals
- `Enter`: Send message
- `Shift + Enter`: New line

### Exporting Conversations
- Click the download icon (üì•) to export your chat
- Conversations are saved as JSON files
- Includes timestamp, model used, and full conversation history

### File Upload (Future Feature)
- Click the upload icon (üìÅ) to upload files
- Currently shows a placeholder message
- Future versions will support RAG with uploaded documents

## Learning Scenarios

### Prompt Engineering
1. Set different system prompts in settings
2. Test how the AI responds to different instructions
3. Experiment with various prompt formats

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
1. Upload relevant documents (when implemented)
2. Ask questions about the uploaded content
3. Compare responses with and without context

### Model Comparison
1. Switch between different models
2. Ask the same question to different models
3. Compare response quality and speed

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI with OpenAI integration
- **Communication**: RESTful API with streaming responses
- **Storage**: Local browser storage for settings and API key

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- Mobile browsers supported

### Security
- API keys stored locally in browser
- No server-side storage of sensitive data
- HTTPS recommended for production use

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API server may not be running"**
- Make sure the backend server is started
- Check that it's running on `http://localhost:8000`
- Verify the API health endpoint responds

**"Invalid API key format"**
- Ensure your API key starts with `sk-`
- Get a new key from OpenAI if needed
- Check for extra spaces or characters

**Messages not sending**
- Verify your API key is saved
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure the backend server is running

**Styling issues**
- Clear browser cache
- Try a different browser
- Check for browser extensions that might interfere

### Getting Help

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify the backend server is running and accessible
3. Test with a simple message first
4. Try refreshing the page

## Development

### File Structure
```
frontend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html      # Main HTML file
