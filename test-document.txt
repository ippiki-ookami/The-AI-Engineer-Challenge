LLM Bootcamp - Test Document

This is a sample document for testing the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality in homework 02.

Key Concepts:
- Embeddings: Vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning
- RAG: Combines retrieval of relevant documents with language model generation
- Vector Databases: Store and search embeddings efficiently
- Semantic Search: Find documents based on meaning rather than exact keywords

Example Use Cases:
1. Document Q&A: Ask questions about uploaded documents
2. Knowledge Base Search: Find relevant information from a collection of texts
3. Content Summarization: Extract key insights from large documents
4. Citation Generation: Provide sources for generated answers

This document contains information about machine learning, natural language processing, and document retrieval systems. It can be used to test the upload functionality and search capabilities of the RAG system.

The system should be able to:
- Upload and process this text file
- Extract and display content in the debug panel
- Search for keywords like "embeddings", "RAG", or "vector"
- Return relevant excerpts when queried

Test Keywords: artificial intelligence, semantic search, document processing, machine learning
