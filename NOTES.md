From now on, to run the server locally, you should cd to the root of the project (The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/) and use this command:
python3 -m uvicorn api.app:app --reload --port 8000
Let's break that down:
python3 -m uvicorn: Runs the Uvicorn web server as a module.
api.app:app: This is the crucial part. It tells Uvicorn where to find your FastAPI instance. It means: "in the api package, look in the app module for the variable named app".
--reload: This is a great feature for development. It automatically restarts the server whenever you save a change in your code.
--port 8000: Specifies the port to run on.
By using this command, you create a consistent environment for both local testing and Vercel deployment. You shouldn't have to change that import statement ever again
