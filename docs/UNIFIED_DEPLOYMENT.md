# Unified Homework Platform Deployment

## 🎯 Perfect Code Isolation with Seamless UI

Your homework platform now supports **complete code isolation** while maintaining a **seamless user experience**:

- ✅ **Each homework's code is completely separate** - no cross-contamination
- ✅ **Seamless switching via dropdown** - feels like one app
- ✅ **Single deployment** - all homework available at once
- ✅ **Individual development** - work on homework 03 without affecting 01

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Development (Local)
```bash
# Run unified platform with all homework
python scripts/run_feature.py --unified

# Or run individual homework (isolated)
python scripts/run_feature.py --feature 01-vibe-check
```

### Production (Vercel)
```bash
# Deploy the unified platform
vercel

# Now all homework is available at your-app.vercel.app
# Users can switch between homework using the dropdown
```

## 🏗️ How Isolation Works

### Backend Isolation
```python
# api/homework_app.py routes to isolated handlers
def load_homework_handler(feature_id):
    # Each homework handler is loaded independently
    # No code sharing except explicit base imports
    handler_path = f"features/{feature_id}/backend/handler.py"
    # ... dynamic import of isolated code
```

### Frontend Isolation
```javascript
// frontend/homework-platform.js
async loadHomeworkModules(homeworkId) {
    // Each homework can have its own JavaScript module
    const homeworkModule = await import(`/features/${homeworkId}/frontend/${homeworkId}.js`);
    // Apply homework-specific behavior without affecting others
}
```

## 📁 File Structure for Isolation

```
features/
├── 01-vibe-check/          # Completely isolated
│   ├── backend/
│   │   ├── handler.py      # Only imports from base/ (explicit)
│   │   └── app.py          # Individual homework server
│   └── frontend/
│       ├── vibe-check.js   # Homework-specific extensions
│       └── vibe-check.css  # Homework-specific styles

├── 02-embeddings-rag/      # Completely isolated
│   ├── backend/

## 🎯 Deployment Options

### Option A: Unified Platform (Recommended)
**Single app, all homework accessible via dropdown**

```bash
# Development
python scripts/run_feature.py --unified

# Production
vercel  # Uses api/homework_app.py
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Perfect for showcasing all your work
- ✅ Seamless user experience
- ✅ Single URL to share
- ✅ All homework remains isolated in code

### Option B: Individual Homework Apps
**Each homework as a separate deployment**

```bash
# Deploy homework 01 only
python scripts/run_feature.py --feature 01-vibe-check

# Each homework can be deployed independently
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Perfect for focusing on one homework
- ✅ Smaller deployment size
- ✅ Independent scaling

## 🔧 Adding New Homework

1. **Create isolated homework folder:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p features/04-your-homework/{backend,frontend}
   ```

2. **Create isolated handler:**
   ```python
   # features/04-your-homework/backend/handler.py
   from base.backend.base_handler import BaseChatHandler  # Explicit import
   
   class YourHomeworkHandler(BaseChatHandler):
       # Your isolated homework code
       pass
   ```

3. **Add to unified app:**
   ```python
   # api/homework_app.py
   HOMEWORK_FEATURES = {
       "04-your-homework": {
           "name": "Your Homework",
           "handler_class": "YourHomeworkHandler",
           "enabled": True
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Test isolation:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_unified.py
   ```

## 🎨 UI Customization Per Homework

Each homework can customize the UI while sharing the base:

```css
/* features/02-embeddings-rag/frontend/rag.css */
.homework-02-embeddings-rag .upload-panel {
    /* Only shows in RAG homework */
    display: block;
}

.homework-01-vibe-check .upload-panel {
    /* Hidden in vibe check */
    display: none;
}
```

```javascript
// features/03-agents/frontend/agents.js
// Homework-specific extensions
export const extensions = {
    showAgentTools() {
        // Only available in agents homework
    }
};
```

## 📊 Explaining Homework Code

When explaining homework code, you can show:

### For Homework 01 - Vibe Check:
```python
# features/01-vibe-check/backend/handler.py
# This code ONLY affects the vibe check homework
class VibeCheckHandler(BaseChatHandler):
    def process_user_message(self, request):
        # Vibe check specific logic
        if "vibe check" in message.lower():
            return enhanced_message
        return message
```

### For Homework 02 - RAG:
```python
# features/02-embeddings-rag/backend/handler.py  
# This code ONLY affects the RAG homework
# Completely isolated from vibe check
class RAGHandler(BaseChatHandler):
    def enhance_messages(self, messages, request):
        # RAG-specific context injection
        context = self.search_documents(request.user_message)
        return self.inject_context(messages, context)
```

## 🎉 Benefits of This Architecture

### For Learning:
- **Clear separation** - understand each homework in isolation
- **Progressive complexity** - build on previous homework by choice
- **No confusion** - homework 03 code doesn't mix with homework 01

### For Development:
- **Work safely** - changing homework 03 won't break homework 01
- **Easy debugging** - problems are isolated to specific homework
- **Clean git history** - changes clearly belong to specific homework

### For Deployment:
- **Flexible deployment** - unified or individual
- **Easy sharing** - one URL showcases all homework
- **Vercel compatible** - works with your existing setup

This is exactly what you wanted: **complete code isolation** with **seamless user experience**! 🚀
